# SNVector

SNVector is a light-weight vector editor, which allows regular users to edit vector graphics on iOS devices. 

While Adobe Illustrator is a de-facto standard vector graphics editor for professional designers, it is quite hard to use for regular users because it forces users to manipulate control points directly.

SNVector offers more direct and intuitive manipulation, by hiding all the complexity associted with control points.
